# üìä Project Title: Manufacturing Data Analysis (SQL Project)

## üìñ Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **SQL** for analyzing a **manufacturing dataset**, specifically focusing on **cellphone sales and transactions**.  
The database design follows a **star schema**, consisting of **dimension tables** (customers, dates, locations, manufacturers, models) and a **fact table** (transactions).  

The project showcases the ability to query, join, and extract insights from structured data to answer real-world business questions.
